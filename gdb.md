gdb -ex=r --args myprogram arg1 arg2


gdb -ex=r --args myprogram arg1 arg2

-ex=r is short for -ex=run and tells gdb to run your program immediately, rather than wait for you to type "run" at the prompt. Then --args says that everything that follows is the command and arguments, just as you'd normally type them at the commandline prompt.
